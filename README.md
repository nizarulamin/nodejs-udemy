# Sssup! Me going through nodejs course here
## Learnings so far
1. Fundamentals of Node.js, core modules, and NPM (Node Package Manager)
2. How Node.js works behind the scenes: event loop, blocking vs non-blocking code, event-driven architecture, streams, modules, etc.
3. Fundamentals of Express (Node.js framework): routing, middleware, sending responses, etc. (ongoing)
